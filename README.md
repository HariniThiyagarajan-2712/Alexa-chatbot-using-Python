ALEXA CHATBOT USING PYTHON:
Alexa is a Python-based voice assistant that responds to various voice commands to perform tasks such as playing songs on YouTube, providing the current time, fetching information from Wikipedia, telling jokes, and more. This project leverages several Python libraries to process voice commands and execute corresponding actions.
